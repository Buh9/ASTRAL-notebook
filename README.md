# ASTRAL Project
I want to add some info about this project; I built a custom star counter which counted stars okay, using LICK data I was able to get ok results though probably a bit below range. I also want to give warning about anyone who would copy and reuse my code. 
## Filesystem
```python
#Organize data
source_dir = '...your_file_directory/'
```
always end the file directory with that slash(/) if you don't the directories will not work and you wont be able to start the filtering process.
also if you are finished with the filtered files, the filtered fits files are in ```...your_file_directory/Reduced/Data_files/```.
